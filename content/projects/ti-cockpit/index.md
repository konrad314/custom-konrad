title: "Ti cockpit"
---

A lightweight, structurally disciplined cockpit machined from titanium, designed to survive vibration, weather, and time without apology. This project explores material choice, load paths, fastener strategy, and the practical limits of fabrication when durability matters more than mass production.

Beyond the finished part, the focus is on design decisions: why titanium here, where stiffness actually matters, and how to balance aesthetics, serviceability, and structural honesty in a small but critical assembly.
