title: "Ignition-to-logic EMI isolation"
---

This project develops a practical shielding and layout strategy to isolate disruptive, high-energy ignition electronics from sensitive, low-current solid-state control and sensing logic. The goal is robust electrical behavior in the real world: predictable switching, reduced noise coupling, and clean signal integrity under vibration, temperature changes, and transient events.

The work will cover enclosure and barrier concepts, grounding and return-path discipline, cable routing and connector choices, and verification approaches that focus on failure modes rather than theory alone.

Stay tuned … 🚧
