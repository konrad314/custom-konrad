title: "Ti cockpit"
---

A lightweight, structurally disciplined cockpit machined from titanium, designed to survive vibration, weather, and time without apology. The focus is on structural clarity, durability, and clean integration rather than visual novelty.

The project centers on practical design decisions: why titanium is appropriate for this application, where stiffness actually matters, how load paths are managed, and how modern instrumentation and controls are integrated in a serviceable, electrically clean way. Components include a Motogadget instrument, a Garmin GPS, a heated grip controller, and supporting switches and indicators.
