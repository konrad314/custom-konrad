title: "Modern electronics rewire"
---

This project documents a modern electrical rewire applied to an air-cooled BMW boxer, with emphasis on reliability, serviceability, and EMI discipline.

This project documents a ground-up rethink of the electrical system on classic BMW airheads, replacing brittle, failure-prone wiring with a modern, serviceable architecture. The goal is not cosmetic modernization, but electrical clarity: predictable behavior, clean fault isolation, and long-term reliability under real riding conditions.

Topics include solid-state power distribution, load segmentation, grounding strategy, protection philosophy, and integration of modern peripherals without compromising the character or maintainability of the original platform.
