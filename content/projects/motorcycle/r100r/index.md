title: "R100R - an evolution"
---

My R100R is an ongoing build rather than a fixed design. This project tracks the mechanical, electrical, and philosophical evolution of the motorcycle over time, documenting decisions, reversals, and refinements as understanding deepens.

Rather than presenting a final “spec,” the focus is on process: how constraints shape solutions, how use reveals weaknesses, and how incremental changes accumulate into a coherent, personal machine.


Stay tuned … 🚧
