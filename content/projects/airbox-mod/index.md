title: "Airbox modification"
---

This project investigates targeted airbox modifications intended to improve service access, filtration behavior, and integration with modern intake components—without sacrificing intake stability or drivability. The emphasis is on controlled changes rather than wholesale replacement.

Design tradeoffs, sealing strategies, airflow considerations, and long-term maintenance implications are discussed, along with lessons learned from iterative prototyping and real-world use.
