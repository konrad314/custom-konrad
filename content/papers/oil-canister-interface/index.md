## Abstract

This paper documents the later-style BMW Airhead oil filter canister mouth geometry and explains how unintended **radial jacking** during installation can plastically deform the sealing land, alter stack-up, and increase leak risk.

The goal is practical: help owners recognize the interface, understand the mechanics, and avoid repeat damage.

## Scope and assumptions

- Linear elastic behavior assumed except where noted  
  (local yielding at the canister mouth is the observed failure mode)
- Focus is the canister mouth / cover interface and common service workflows
- Engineering interpretation aimed at **failure prevention**, not post-hoc blame

---

## Key takeaway

If the installation path creates an **eccentric point contact** that drives the canister laterally, the canister behaves like a short stiff shell: it will *walk* and locally thicken/stiffen the mouth, reducing clearance and causing torque to rise **sooner and more abruptly** than expected.
