## Abstract
This note documents the later-style BMW Airhead oil filter canister mouth geometry and explains how unintended **radial jacking** during installation can plastically deform the sealing land, alter stack-up, and increase leak risk. The goal is practical: help owners recognize the interface, understand the mechanics, and avoid repeat damage.

## Scope and assumptions
- Linear elastic behavior assumed except where noted (local yielding at the mouth is the observed failure mode).
- Focus is the canister mouth / cover interface and common service workflows.
- This is an engineering interpretation aimed at failure prevention.

## Key takeaway
If the installation path creates an **eccentric point contact** that drives the canister laterally, the canister behaves like a short stiff shell: it will “walk” and locally thicken/stiffen the mouth, reducing clearance and making torque rise sooner and more abruptly.
