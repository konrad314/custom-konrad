I believe it’s better to regret what you’ve done than regret never trying. That’s why, decades ago, I left everything familiar behind—my country, my friends, and my family—to come to the United States for college. And it’s the same reason I’m here today—taking a custom 1983 BMW R80 enduro even further, and transforming a stock 1993 BMW R100 into a purpose-built modern roadster.

## Philosophy

Custom Konrad is about **Adventure, Integrity, and Engineering**.

It’s about doing things the hard way when that’s the right way. About respecting the history behind every tool, every part, every method—whether it’s a motorcycle that crossed the Sahara Desert or software like NASTRAN that’s been certifying aircraft for over fifty years.

It’s about trusting your own judgment, learning from your mistakes, and committing fully—even when it costs more time, money, or comfort than you planned.

## Invitation

If you care about craftsmanship, about understanding why things work—not just how—and about the satisfaction that comes from building something you believe in, I hope you’ll join me.

Whether I’m wiring a motorcycle, reflecting on lessons from mentors, or sharing the mindset that’s guided me across continents, this is where I tell that story.

**This is Custom Konrad. Welcome.**
