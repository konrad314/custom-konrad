I believe it’s better to regret what you’ve done than regret never trying. That’s why, decades ago, I left everything familiar behind—my country, my friends, and my family—to come to the United States for college. It’s the same impulse that brings me here today: identifying systems worth understanding, then improving them with care.

## Philosophy

Custom Konrad is about Adventure, Integrity, and Engineering.

It’s about doing things the hard way when that’s the right way. About respecting the history behind every tool, every part, every method—whether it’s a motorcycle component that earned its place through miles and failure modes, or software like NASTRAN that has helped certify aircraft for decades.

It’s about trusting your own judgment, learning from your mistakes, and committing fully—even when it costs more time, money, or comfort than you planned.

## Invitation

If you care about craftsmanship, about understanding why things work—not just how—and about the satisfaction that comes from improving something you believe in, I hope you’ll join me.

Whether I’m refining a motorcycle subsystem, documenting a networking setup, or sharing lessons learned along the way, this is where I tell that story.

This is Custom Konrad. Welcome.
